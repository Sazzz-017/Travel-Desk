# TravelDesk

## Overview
TravelDesk is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of employee travel requests within an organization. Built on SAPUI5 and OData V4 services, it allows employees to submit travel requests, including destination, dates, and purpose. Managers can review these requests, approve or reject them, and track the status of all travel activities.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Travel Requests**: Employees can create requests that immediately appear in a personalized travel request table.  
- **Managerial Workflow**: Managers can efficiently review, approve, or reject requests.  
- **Automatic Filtering**: Requests are filtered dynamically to show only relevant data for the logged-in user.  
- **Audit-ready Tracking**: Each request maintains timestamps, status updates, and a detailed history for audit purposes.  
- **Intuitive UI5 Interface**: SAPUI5 ensures seamless navigation and a user-friendly experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: SAPUI5  
- **Backend / Services**: OData V4 services  
- **Framework**: CAP (Cloud Application Programming Model) or underlying CDS-based service
